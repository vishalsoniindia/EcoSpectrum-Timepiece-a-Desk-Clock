# EcoSpectrum-Timepiece-a-Desk-Clock
I created the EcoSpectrum Timepiece to blend functionality with the beauty of nature. This desk clock features a vibrant rainbow and serene nature background, providing a visually pleasing way to keep track of time and date. It updates via the internet, ensuring accuracy, and brings a touch of colorful tranquility to any space.
